                    <h2>Best Anime Ever! XD</h2>

                    <p>
                        Ever since he was a child, fifteen-year-old Souma Yukihira has helped his father by 
                        working as the sous chef in the restaurant his father runs and owns. Throughout the 
                        years, Souma developed a passion for entertaining his customers with his creative, 
                        skilled, and daring culinary creations. His dream is to someday own his family's 
                        restaurant as its head chef. <br>

                        Yet when his father suddenly decides to close the restaurant to test his cooking 
                        abilities in restaurants around the world, he sends Souma to Tootsuki Culinary Academy,
                        an elite cooking school where only 10 percent of the students graduate. The institution
                        is famous for its "Shokugeki" or "food wars," where students face off in intense,
                        high-stakes cooking showdowns.

                    <p>t is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a 
                        page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less 
                        normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it 
                        look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem 
                        Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still 
                        in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes 
                        on purpose (injected humour and the like).
